Upgrading OTRS from 3.3 to 3.4
==============================

These instructions are for people upgrading OTRS from *3.3* to *3.4*
or from a *3.4.x* to a later release *3.4.y* and applies both for RPM
and source code (tarball) upgrades.

If you are running a lower version of OTRS you have to follow the upgrade path
to 3.3 first (1.1->1.2->1.3->2.0->2.1->2.2->2.3->2.4->3.0->3.1->3.2->3.3)!
You need to perform a full upgrade to every version in between, including
database changes and the upgrading perl script.

Please note that if you upgrade from OTRS 2.2 or earlier, you have to
take [an extra step](http://bugs.otrs.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6798).

Within a single minor version you can skip patch level releases if you want to
upgrade. For instance you can upgrade directly from OTRS 3.4.1 to version
3.4.4. If you need to do such a "patch level upgrade", you should skip steps
xxxxx.

It is highly recommended to perform a test update on a separate testing machine first.


1. Stop all relevant services
-----------------------------

Please make sure there are no more running services or cronjobs that try to access OTRS.
This will depend on your service configuration, here is an example:

    shell> /etc/init.d/cron stop
    shell> /etc/init.d/postfix stop
    shell> /etc/init.d/apache stop

Stop OTRS cronjobs and the scheduler (in this order):

    shell> cd /opt/otrs/
    shell> bin/Cron.sh stop
    shell> bin/otrs.Scheduler.pl -a stop

2. Backup everything below `/opt/otrs/`
---------------------------------------

- `Kernel/Config.pm`
- `Kernel/Config/GenericAgent.pm`
- `Kernel/Config/Files/ZZZAuto.pm`
- `var/*`
- as well as the database


3. Make sure that you have backed up everything ;-)
---------------------------------------------------


4. Install the new release (tar or RPM)
---------------------------------------

### 4.1 With the tarball:

    shell> cd /opt
    shell> mv otrs otrs-old
    shell> tar -xzf otrs-x.x.x.tar.gz
    shell> mv otrs-x.x.x otrs

#### Restore old configuration files

- `Kernel/Config.pm`
- `Kernel/Config/GenericAgent.pm`
- `Kernel/Config/Files/ZZZAuto.pm`

#### Restore TicketCounter.log

In order to let OTRS continue with the correct ticket number, restore the `TicketCounter.log` to
`$OTRS_HOME/var/log/` (default: `OTRS_HOME=/opt/otrs`). This is especially important if you use incremental ticketnumbers.

#### Restore article data

If you configured OTRS to store article data in the filesystem you have to restore the `article` folder to `$OTRS_HOME/var/` (default: `OTRS_HOME=/opt/otrs`).

#### Set file permissions

Please execute

     shell> cd /opt/otrs/
     shell> bin/otrs.SetPermissions.pl

with the permissions needed for your system setup. For example:

- Web server which runs as the OTRS user:

        shell> bin/otrs.SetPermissions.pl --otrs-user=otrs --web-user=otrs /opt/otrs

- Webserver with wwwrun user (e. g. SUSE):

        shell> bin/otrs.SetPermissions.pl --otrs-user=otrs --web-user=wwwrun /opt/otrs

- Webserver with apache user (e. g. Red Hat, CentOS):

        shell> bin/otrs.SetPermissions.pl --otrs-user=otrs --web-user=apache --otrs-group=apache --web-group=apache /opt/otrs

- Webserver with www-data user (e. g. Debian, Ubuntu):

        shell> bin/otrs.SetPermissions.pl --otrs-user=otrs --web-user=www-data --otrs-group=www-data --web-group=www-data /opt/otrs

### 4.2 With the RPM:

    shell> rpm -Uvh otrs-x.x.x.-01.rpm

In this case the RPM update automatically restores the old configuration files and sets file permissions.


5. Check needed Perl modules
----------------------------

Verify that all needed perl modules are installed on your system and install
any modules that might be missing.

     shell> /opt/otrs/bin/otrs.CheckModules.pl


6. Apply the database changes
-----------------------------

### 6.1 Database schema update

#### MySQL:

Note: new tables created in the MySQL UPGRADING process will be created with the
default table storage engine set in your MySQL server.
In MySQL 5.5 the new default type is `InnoDB`.
If existing tables, e.g. "users", have the table storage engine e.g. `MyISAM`,
then an error will be displayed when creating the foreign key constraints.

You have two options: you can change the default storage engine of MySQL back to `MyISAM`
so that new tables will have the same engine as the existing tables,
or change the existing tables to use InnoDB as storage engine.

Any problems with regards to the storage engine will be reported by the
`otrs.CheckDB.pl` script, so please run it to check for possible issues.

    shell> cd /opt/otrs/
    shell> bin/otrs.CheckDB.pl
    shell> cat scripts/DBUpdate-to-3.4.mysql.sql | mysql -p -f -u root otrs

#### PostgreSQL:

    shell> cd /opt/otrs/
    shell> cat scripts/DBUpdate-to-3.4.postgresql.sql | psql --set ON_ERROR_STOP=on --single-transaction otrs otrs

### 6.2 Database migration script

Run the migration script (as user `otrs`, NOT as `root`):

    shell> scripts/DBUpdate-to-3.4.pl

Do not continue the upgrading process if this script did not work properly for you.
Otherwise data loss may occur.


7. Own themes
-------------

Note: The OTRS themes of 3.3 are NOT compatible with 3.4, so don't use your old themes!

Themes are located under `/opt/otrs/Kernel/Output/HTML/*/*.tt`.

Please note that OTRS 3.4 comes with a new templating engine based on
[Template::Toolkit](http://www.template-toolkit.org). All customized templates must be converted from
DTL to the new format. Please see
[the development manual](http://otrs.github.io/doc/manual/developer/3.4/en/html/package-porting.html#package-porting-template-engine)
for detailed instructions.


8. Refresh the configuration cache and delete caches
-----------------------------------------------------

Please run (as user `otrs`, *not* as `root`):

    shell> bin/otrs.RebuildConfig.pl
    shell> bin/otrs.DeleteCache.pl


9. Restart your services
-------------------------

e. g. (depends on used services):

    shell> /etc/init.d/apache start
    shell> /etc/init.d/postfix start
    shell> /etc/init.d/cron start

Now you can log into your system.


10. Update and activate cronjobs
--------------------------------

There are several OTRS default cronjobs in `/opt/otrs/var/cron/*.dist`.
They can be activated by copying them without the ".dist" filename extension.
Do this to make sure you get the latest versions of the cronjobs and new cronjobs
as well.

    shell> cd /opt/otrs/var/cron
    shell> for foo in *.dist; do cp $foo `basename $foo .dist`; done

Please check the copied files and re-apply any customizations that you might have made.

To schedule these cronjobs on your system, you can use the script `Cron.sh`.
Make sure to execute it as the `otrs` user!

    shell> /opt/otrs/bin/Cron.sh start


11. Check installed packages
----------------------------

In the package manager, check if all packages are still marked as
correctly installed or if any require reinstallation or even a package upgrade.

The following packages are automatically uninstalled after the upgrade process (if they where
installed before):

- OTRSGenericInterfaceREST
- OTRSMyServices
- OTRSStatsRestrictionByDateTimeDF
- Support


12. Update Customer database configuration
------------------------------------------

If you're using an external customer database and this database does NOT provide the OTRS specific fields
create_time, create_by, change_time and change_by, please set `ForeignDB => 1`
for `$Self->{CustomerUser}` and `$Self->{CustomerCompany}`
(see [Defaults.pm](Kernel/Config/Defaults.pm)).


13. Rebuild Ticket index
--------------

Please run `bin/otrs.RebuildTicketIndex.pl` to regenerate the ticket index.
This can be done in the background to calculate the ticket numbers for the queue view screens.
You can already use your system.


14. Well done!
